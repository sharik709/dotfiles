# Dotfiles: Because Default Settings Are for Mortals

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This is where I keep all my configuration files, scripts, and random tweaks that make my computer feel like home. If you're here, you're either curious, bored, or you accidentally clicked the wrong link. Either way, welcome aboard! ðŸ˜„

## What's Inside?

- **.bashrc / .zshrc**: Because typing the same commands over and over is for amateurs.
- **.vimrc**: Turning Vim into a spaceship, one plugin at a time.
- **.gitconfig**: Git aliases so powerful, they might unionize. (Find it you can)
- **.tmux.conf**: For when you need 37 terminal panes open at once or maybe none. So, didn't add it.
- **Random Scripts**: Automating the boring stuff so I can spend more time breaking things. Thinking from the dawn of time but didn't come up with any automation idea. I know genius.

## Installation
Figure it out.
## Disclaimer

These dotfiles are tailored to my personal preferences. If you use them, you might:
- Break your system.
- Question your life choices.
- Accidentally summon a terminal demon.
- Or simply, fuck up. Don't come crying to me.

Use at your own risk. No refunds.

Don't feel free to create PR because I don't give shit. Keep your PRs to yourself. Fuck off!

Enjoy the chaos! ðŸ™ƒ
